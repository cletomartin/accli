# General

* Rename `data_dir` to `accli_repo`.

* A ~/.accli would be a good idea to simplify global options like the
  path to the `accli_repo` directory. It would be also good to support
  environment variables for these parameters as it is done
  `accli/config.py`


# Invoices

## Generate

* Allow to provide the full path to the YAML or just the invoice id.

* Allow to specify different kind of input and output formats.
